    "- to have an animation only for aggregated weekdays and weekends data - which would be represented by 1-2 seconds per week, with either just weekdays or just weekends.\n",
    "- to have a heat map showing for each zone the difference between the average of *incoming* passengers between weekdays and weekends (so for each zone we have a map, that uses a color code to show where people are mostly coming from, and whether it is more on weekdays or on weekends).\n",

    "The purpose of this analysis was to see whether there are some trends in the flow of passengers using the NYC yellow taxis in 2018. \n",

    "Two blog posts were written to expose both the method exposed in this notebook and the part I notebook, as well as the results:\n",
    "- the results : https://medium.com/@mozart38/where-do-people-go-in-nyc-5-facts-and-observations-of-2018-57308d26d7c8\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But in a nutshell, here are the observations we made:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can we see trends in the flow of passengers in 2018?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! There are some main pick up and drop off centers, among them Manhattan, the airports, and Manhattan nearby Brooklyn and Queens.\n",
    "We observed that passengers usually come to these neighborhoods from a nearby neighborhood (radius of about 3–4km), and tend to reach out to neighborhood within a 5–6km distance in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is there a difference on holidays, hottest or coldest day of the year?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! It seems like on bank holidays people take less the taxi, and that points out that probably yellow taxi passengers are mostly workers, using the taxi during working days.\n",
    "Regarding the impact off the weather, it was not evident, to the exception of the 4th of January, blizzard day that saw very little traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is there a difference between weekdays and weekends?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! Weekdays appear to be much busier than weekends! This reinforces the idea that yellow taxi passengers are mostly workers.\n",
    "Besides, it looks like people actually come from further, and go further on weekends than the usual radius we mentioned in the first question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depending on the zone we look at, where are people most likely to come from? To go to? Is it different between weekdays and weekends?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We highlighted that some neighborhoods are strongly connected:\n",
    "- Manhattan, and in particular Upper East Side North and South\n",
    "- JFK and La Guardia airport with Manhattan for incoming traffic and the whole city for outgoing traffic\n",
    "- Manhattan close by neighborhood in Queens and Brooklyn"
